								<p>Shown above is one of the first lifts of Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry’s launch rail. The rail itself is a project I led with two other members of my team. Together we put in hours of high-level design work and project planning. The rail itself stands 28 feet tall, and is made out of four 7 foot sections. There’s no part that is longer than 7 feet, and the whole thing is bolted together with a system of gusset plates. Its purpose is to launch as large as an 8 inch diameter rocket, while being able to fit inside of something as small as a U-Haul. </p>

								<p>Designing, manufacturing, and assembling a system of this size was no small task. It required collaboration and communication between multiple parties: designers, treasurers, machinists, and assemblers. For any one subsystem of the rail, we had to make sure we ordered material in time, to allow enough time to machine the material to specification, so that we could assemble and stay on schedule. Having a top down view of this process and understanding how these parties interacted was the hardest but most rewarding part of this process. </p>

								<p>An example of one of these subsystems is the gusset plates that hold the truss structure of the launch rail together. I designed the gusset plates so that one shape could serve the purpose of adjoining metal at multiple different locations, to make the assembly as simple as possible. The design of these plates went from a CAD part, to an assembly, to an AutoCAD file, before they were waterjetted and painted. </p>

								<p>Over the course of just over a semester, these subsystems came together to make one launch rail. That rail was brought out to the desert in Mojave, California, and assembled at the Friends of Amatuer Rocketry launch facility. It sent our rocket up into the sky straight and true, and fulfilled its purpose. Work will continue on this rail to improve it and ensure it can be used by the Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry club for years to come. </p>
