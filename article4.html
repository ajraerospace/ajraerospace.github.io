								<p>I made the drone pictured over the course of a few weeks during high school. It was my first time building a system from the top-down: I had an obsession with quadcopters that you could fly from a first-person view, and since I couldn’t afford to buy one, I had to find a way to make it myself. </p>
								<p>Through the process of researching components to buy, I learned much about drones and how they operate. I learned about the patterned clockwise/counter-clockwise rotations of rotors to balance its angular momentum, how a motors kilovolt rating dictates the battery and propellers used, and about different radio frequencies, like 5 and 2.6GHz. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/droneimg3.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I also learned much through the process of creating the drone. I learned how to solder, about different information transfer protocols and how to wire them, and about the importance of safety, even on a small scale. I also learned that everything doesn’t always go to plan, and that integration of parts is important to have an organized final product.</p>
								<p>This project was a learning experience for me. There were many obstacles I had to overcome, but I always learned something in the process. It taught me that while at times a project might seem doomed to fail, it makes the perseverance to the end product all the more satisfying. </p>
