								<p>During the summer of 2021, I took a position as a seasonal groundskeeper at Cape Cod Gateway Airport. It was a great experience that taught me how an airport operates, the safety measures that keep us safe when we fly, and the technologies that assist pilots. </p>
								<p>While the majority of my time at the airport was spent groundskeeping, I always focus on the standards of my work. I take pride in anything I do, and the weedwacking of the area shown below is no exception. </p>

								<p>However, there were more exciting aspects to working at the airport. Within my first week, I was brought through AOA driver training, and learned about movement areas, SIDA zones, appropriate spacing for planes, how to yield to planes, and picking up FOD. Moving about the runway was some of the best time I had at the airport, driving carefully alongside everything from small chartered cessnas to Boeing A320’s. </p>

								<p>In addition to the operations knowledge I gained, I also learned about specific technologies the airport uses to communicate with pilots and ensure safe landing and takeoff. For example, I learned that a PAPI (precision approach path indicator) assists pilots upon landing by refracting light at an angle that can be seen upon proper approach. I learned the phrase “red over white, you’re alright”, among others, before seeing the inside of the PAPI, and how the mechanics were able to accurately level the system to FAA standards. </p>
