									<h1>Mach 3<br />
									Composite Airframe</h1>
									
								</header>
								<p>Mr. Blue Sky was Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry’s two-stage sounding rocket for the 2021-2022 school year. It had a projected apogee of 140,000 feet and a maximum speed of Mach 3.2, a much higher mach regime than the slightly supersonic rockets the club had fired in the past. This made designing and manufacturing a robust airframe a top priority and large responsibility for myself as a newly instated lead for the aerostructures team. The process of designing the fins’ composite was no small task, and deserves its own post. Instead, this post will focus on the manufacturing of the rockets’ fin cans.  </p>
								<p>The process started from waterjetting the fins’ frames and putting a bevel on their edge to reduce drag. Seen below is my teammate Parth adding a bevel to the leading edge of a fin frame with an end mill.  </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Next, the middle layer of the fin composite sandwich was completed by epoxying a layer of nomex to the frames. This material allows for great thermal dissipation as well as great compressive strength. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Completing the fins involved a layup of multiple layers of pre-preg carbon fiber, a vacuum bag, and an autoclave cycle. Seen below are the layers of vacuum bag used in most composites work: perforated release film (in red) which allows for excess epoxy in the carbon to be released and soaked into the bleeder cloth (in white), so it does not interfere with the vacuum bag (in green). </p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Once cured, the root chord of the fins were sanded to a planar surface after for attachment to the airframe.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Next, the fins were attached by tacking them onto the airframe with an updated version of the Fin Jig I described in a previous post and adding a fillet which helps to increase strength at the root chord. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin6.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After the fins were attached and the fillets added, it was time to prepare for the most important process in the airframe’s development: the tip-to-tip layup. Around 50 pieces of twill weave pre-preg carbon were cut for use in the layup. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin8.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The layup itself took place at Delta Airline's Tech Operations Composites Shop. They were kind enough to provide us with a work space, and more importantly, access to their large autoclave which could fit both stages of our rocket’s airframe at once. Seen below are some members of the team applying layers to the fin can, as well as a photo of myself next to the airframe after its been put under vacuum. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin9.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin11.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The result of the layup was two incredibly strong set of fins ready to be sanded and handed off to the internals team for integration. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin10.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Below is a photo of myself next to Mr. Blue Sky’s booster fin can before launch in Mojave, CA. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/fin14.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The launch of Mr. Blue Sky was anomalous, subject to issues with our staging mechanism. This anomaly caused a failure in our recovery system, and a flight regime less than Mach 2. Below is a photo of the booster can I had stood next to, after falling balistically from 10,000 feet. While the fins were not able to experience the flight speeds they were designed for, they did survive freefall from an astounding height, which is a win in my book! </p>
